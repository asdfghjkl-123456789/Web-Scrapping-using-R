# Web-Scrapping-using-R

This R script extracts key information from a webpage, including headings, text, links, images, and tables. 
After installing and loading the necessary libraries (rvest, dplyr, and stringr), it prompts the user to enter a URL. 
The scrape_data() function then retrieves the webpage content, extracts relevant elements, and displays the results. 
If an invalid URL is provided, the script handles the error gracefully without crashing.
